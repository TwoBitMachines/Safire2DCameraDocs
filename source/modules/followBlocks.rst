Follow Blocks
+++++++++++++

Create and arrange a series of follow blocks to guide the camera
in horizontal or vertical pathways. Once the target enters one of these blocks,
the camera is locked and can only move in that axis. This is helpful if the game level
requires only certain pathways for the camera to travel in. Typically you put a horizontal
block next to a vertical block and so on.
